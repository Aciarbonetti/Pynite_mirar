# PyNite
A 3D frame, truss, and beam finite element library for Python. PyNite is still a relatively new project, and as such may still have a few bugs in it. Documentation is gradually improving. New features are being added on a regular basis and sample problems are being run through it to isolate errors and bugs. PyNite's accuracy and capabilities are improving rapidly. Documentation will continue to improve as well.
