# PyNite
A 3D frame, truss, and beam finite element library for Python.

# Contributors Welcome
If you would like to contribute to this project to expand, debug or improve it, I am looking for more contributors. I'd like to get the library solving more than just frames. I would also like to add graphics capabilities and a user interface, but I'm not sure I have the time to tackle that project myself. If you have experience in these areas your contribution would be greatly appreciated. If not, your contributions and ideas are still welcome. Contact me through GitHub and let me know if you're interested.
