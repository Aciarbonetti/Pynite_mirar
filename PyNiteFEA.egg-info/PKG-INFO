        # Contributors Welcome
        If you would like to contribute to this project to expand, debug or improve it, I welcome your contributions. I'd like to get the library solving more than just frames. I would also like to add graphics capabilities and a user interface, but I'm not sure I have the time to tackle that project myself. If you have experience in these areas your contribution would be greatly appreciated. If not, your contributions and ideas are still welcome. Feel free to issue pull requests.
