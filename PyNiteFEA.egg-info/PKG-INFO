Description: # PyNite
        A 3D frame, truss, and beam finite element library for Python.
        
        # Dependencies
        PyNite depends on the following packages:
        * numpy: used for matrix algebra
        * matplotlib: used for plotting member diagrams
        * vtk: used for visualization - note that vtk requires a 64 bit installation of python. vtk does not need to be installed if you don't plan to used the visualization tools in PyNite.
        
        # Contributors Welcome
        If you would like to contribute to this project to expand, debug or improve it, I welcome your contributions. I'd like to get the library solving more than just frames. Feel free to issue pull requests.
